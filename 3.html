<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript is an object-based scripting programming language.
  The language is commonly used within web browsers and has the ability
  to access embedded objects in other applications. It is also used in
  server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js.
  JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape
  Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later LiveScript, which
  eventually became JavaScript. Although JavaScript is similar in syntax
  to Microsoft Systems' Java, this is because both languages are based
  on the basic syntax of the C language, and JavaScript is not directly
  related to JavaScript. Aside from the name and syntax, there are more
  similarities to self or skill than Java. ECMAScript is simply
  a standardized version of JavaScript. The release of Mozilla 1.8 Beta
  1 provided partial support for E4X (ECMA-357), an XML-adapted extended
  language XML. JavaScript has different versions supported by different browsers.
